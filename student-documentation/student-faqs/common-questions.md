## **Why is Customer Service not replying to my emails?**

Customer Service emails might be moving to the <mark style="color:blue;">**Spam**</mark> folder. You can revisit the settings of the email service provider.

### **Anti-spam settings for AOL email users:**

* AOL automatically stores mail that appears to be junk mail (or "spam") in a <mark style="color:blue;">**Spam**</mark> folder. Your mail control settings determine how AOL decides which emails are spams. You must check your <mark style="color:blue;">**Spam**</mark> folder frequently to ensure that the Spam filtering system is properly classifying mail as spam. Occasionally, email that is not spam is sent to the <mark style="color:blue;">**Spam**</mark> folder if it does not meet your criteria for acceptable email (for example, banks, membership newsletters, and new friends). If you see an email that is not spam, select it and click <mark style="color:blue;">**This is Not Spam**</mark>. AOL automatically moves the message to your <mark style="color:blue;">**New Mail**</mark> folder. You should then add that email address to your <mark style="color:blue;">**Address Book**</mark> or your <mark style="color:blue;">**Custom Sender List**</mark>, so that future emails from this sender remains in your <mark style="color:blue;">**New Mail**</mark> folder.
* For additional information, view the [AOL Help Center](https://help.aol.com/).

### **SpamGuard setting for Yahoo email users:**

* If you are having trouble receiving emails from NexPort, it is most likely due to the <mark style="color:blue;">**SpamGuard**</mark> that is part of Yahoo. Check your <mark style="color:blue;">**Bulk Mail**</mark> folder often. SpamGuard's default setting is to keep messages in the <mark style="color:blue;">**Bulk Mail**</mark> folder for one month. When you receive an email in the <mark style="color:blue;">**Bulk Mail**</mark> folder that is not junk mail, click the <mark style="color:blue;">**Not Spam**</mark>. This allows it to bypass the SpamGuard. Another option is to add the NexPort Customer Service Address to your <mark style="color:blue;">**Address Book**</mark>.
* For additional information, view the [Yahoo! Anti Spam Resource Center](http://antispam.yahoo.com/).

### **Anti-spam settings for Hotmail or Outlook email users:**

* Hotmail or Outlook is known to put message from senders that are not flagged as **Safe**, or not in your **Address Book** to the **Junk Mail** folder. You can check the contents of your **Junk Mail** folder by clicking the **Junk Email** link. Hotmail or Outlook then displays a list of messages. To move a message from the **Junk Email** folder to the **Inbox** folder, you check the box beside the message. Next, click the **Not Junk**, on the Hotmail or Outlook menu bar. Another option is to add an email address to your **Safe** list.
* Go to the **Options** page. On the left side of the page, click **Mail**, and then click **Junk E-Mail Protection**. Click **Safe List**. Type an address or domain (a domain is the part of an email address that follows the @ sign) from which you always want to receive messages, and then click **Add**.
* For additional information, view the [Outlook support](https://support.office.com/en-us/outlook).

### **Anti-spam settings for Gmail email users:**

* Gmail can store emails in the **Spam** folder because of the reputation of sender or the content of the email. The emails are stored in the **Spam** folder and are deleted after 30 days. You should visit the **Spam** folder regularly. If you see an email that is not spam, select it and click **Not Spam**. This ensures that the email is moved **Inbox** folder. You can also manage the incoming emails using **Filters**. You can create a new filter for NexPort email address and check **Never send it to Spam**.
