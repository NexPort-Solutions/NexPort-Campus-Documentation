You require the latest version of Adobe Acrobat to view PDFs. Click [https://get.adobe.com/reader/](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) and then click **Install now**. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## **Why do I need an additional component installed and configured to run my courses properly?**

Many of the courses are built using the Macromedia Flash Player. This player is used because of its ability to stream audio and video without compromising extensive bandwidth and quality of audio or video. Without this component, many of the courses would not display audio and video within a course.

## **Why does a link provided in the email invite for NexPort Extended Campus not take me to the proper room?**

This is caused by the link that is cut off due to setting in the sender's email account. There should be a second line under the link containing the rest of the room's name. The easiest solution is to copy this second line and paste it onto the end of the room's name. This gives you the correct room name for your event.
