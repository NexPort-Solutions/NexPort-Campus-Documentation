# Documents (Student)

## Documents

Only the documents bookshelf is visible to you and not the administrative bookshelf. NexPort adds some types of documents to the student record. These include completion certificates and transcripts uploaded from the transcript evaluations tool. NexPort stores Transcript Evaluation records in the Administrative documents bookshelf under the transcript evaluations folder and Certificates are placed in the Documents bookshelf under the certificates folder.

You can have one or more files stored as part of your record. You can add, rename, delete and upload documents, other types of files (webpages, image, video, and audio files)

The following table provides the file formats supported by NexPort Campus.
