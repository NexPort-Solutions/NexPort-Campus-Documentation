# Classroom

The classroom is a place which stores all the assignments, lessons, tests, and grades of a section. You can work on the assignments, take lessons, take tests, and view the grades. Also, you can contact an instructor, and view section overview, gradebook, and assignment list. You can view the assigned supplemental assignment in the classroom. You can also view the syllabus assignment assigned to them in the classroom.
