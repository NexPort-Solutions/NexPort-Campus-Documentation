# Take a Test

Test assignments can be set as graded or ungraded, and timed or untimed assignments. On the test assignment page, you can take the following type of tests:

## **Timed tests**

The timed tests are time bound test. You have to complete the test in the set time frame. An instructor has the privilege to set the test attempts (One, Multiple, or Unlimited). You can view the number of attempts you have attended the test, next to the <mark style="color:blue;">**Take Test**</mark> button or <mark style="color:blue;">**Retake Test**</mark> button.&#x20;

When you click <mark style="color:blue;">**Take Test**</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">**Retake Test**</mark> on a test in your classroom, a timer appears in the upper-right corner. For example, when you are attempting a test and when you have less than ten minutes left to complete the test, your timer appears in red. Do not click <mark style="color:blue;">**Submit**</mark> Test until you are ready to submit all of your answers. If you have more than one question to answer on your test, a <mark style="color:blue;">**Skip**</mark> button appears under the question and responses. After you have selected a response, the <mark style="color:blue;">**Skip**</mark> button is displayed as <mark style="color:blue;">**Next**</mark> button.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
After you have exited a test without submitting it, you have five minutes to reenter the test before you are locked out and are no longer able to access your test.
