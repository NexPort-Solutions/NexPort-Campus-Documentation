| <mark style="color:blue;">**Courseware Assignment**</mark>    | Courseware assignments are interactive lessons that may include games, tests or other interactive content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Discussion Assignment**</mark>    | NexPort Campus provides you with the ability to discuss topics with your instructor or other students through the discussion board. The discussion board allows you to create discussion topics and comment back and forth to each other. This is similar to email, but the discussion board is viewable to everyone enrolled in the section and stores all conversations.                                                  |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Media Assignment**</mark>         | Media assignments may include video, images, documents or audio. For videos and audio NexPort will remember the last location you viewed. Your instructor may require you to view an entire video before you can move to the next assignment.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Student Input Assignment**</mark> | Student input assignment includes a template of custom profile or enrollment field inputs for the student to fill in. Instructors can ask you to resubmit input assignments as many times as required or they can set the assignment to be graded automatically. This type of assignment calls for you to enter data through a date picker, text box or check box.                                                          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Survey Assignment**</mark>        | In Survey Assignments, administrators or instructors create surveys using multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and/or comment options. The survey creator can elect to have the survey results provided to them anonymously. Surveys can be given to you as an assignment through the classroom. Surveys can also be given through the [<mark style="color:blue;">**My Events**</mark>](../../../my-events-student.md) menu. |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Test Assignment**</mark>          | Test assignments allow you to take an exam within NexPort Campus. The test assignments can be set as graded or ungraded and timed or untimed assignments. Test questions are always randomized by default. You can attempt the test multiple times.                                                                                                                                                                         |
