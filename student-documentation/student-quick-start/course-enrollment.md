# Course Enrollment

## Enroll in a Training

As a first step, you need to enroll in training. Enrolling in training means you are signing up to participate in that training plan or section. In NexPort Campus, sections are courses that combine one or more assignments. Training plans are similar to college degree plans and describe a set of sections that must be completed to receive a certificate. You can enroll in a training plan or section using the <mark style="color:blue;">**My Training**</mark> menu.
