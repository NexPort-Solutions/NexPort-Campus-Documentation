# Course Participation

After you are enrolled in a training plan and/or section, you must be able to launch the section or training plan to participate in it. In NexPort sections are courses that combine one or more assignments. A training plan is a group of sections used together. There are often prerequisites used to allow the sections to be taken in the proper order. The training plan is analogous to a university degree plan.

To participate in training plan or section, you need to do the following steps:

{% content-ref url="course-navigation.md" %}
[course-navigation.md](course-navigation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="classroom-navigation.md" %}
[classroom-navigation.md](classroom-navigation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="assignment-completion.md" %}
[assignment-completion.md](assignment-completion.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="course-testing.md" %}
[course-testing.md](course-testing.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="monitoring-course-progress.md" %}
[monitoring-course-progress.md](monitoring-course-progress.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
