The upper part in blue is the header where the status of your assignment and any instructions provided by your instructor are displayed. Underneath the header is the assignment on which you work. Some assignments such as courseware and tests have buttons to launch the attached items. Assignments such as discussion and writing have areas for you to type your thoughts and submit them for grading. Some assignments also provide grades in this area if you have taken the assignment previously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
