# Course Navigation

## Navigate your Training Plan or Section

A training plan is a group of sections used together. Students are sometimes asked to appear for the sections in order. Prerequisites are set for the students to follow the workflow.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Step 1:**</mark>  Click <mark style="color:blue;">**My Training > Enrollments**</mark>.

> The <mark style="color:blue;">**Enrollments**</mark> page is displayed.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Step 2:**</mark>  In the <mark style="color:blue;">**Title**</mark> column, click the training plan.

> The <mark style="color:blue;">**Training Plan**</mark> page is displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:blue;">The display on the training plan page is based on the categories that are set up. Each element in the training plan is called a requirement. The following types of requirements are supported by NexPort Campus.</mark>_
{% endhint %}

| Requirement                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Category**</mark>   | Categories are similar to departments or divisions. For example, Categories enable you to have a folder named English with sections and transcripts in the category folder. |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Section**</mark>    | Sections are classes in which a user can enroll.                                                                                                                            |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Elective**</mark>   | Electives are sections that a user can select among other alternative sections. Electives can have categories.                                                              |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Transcript**</mark> | Transcripts provide an overall look at the progress and status for sections a user has taken. Transcripts are best within categories.                                       |
