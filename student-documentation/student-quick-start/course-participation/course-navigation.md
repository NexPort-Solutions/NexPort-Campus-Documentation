| <mark style="color:blue;">**Elective**</mark>   | Electives are sections that a user can select among other alternative sections. Electives can have categories.                                                              |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Transcript**</mark> | Transcripts provide an overall look at the progress and status for sections a user has taken. Transcripts are best within categories.                                       |
