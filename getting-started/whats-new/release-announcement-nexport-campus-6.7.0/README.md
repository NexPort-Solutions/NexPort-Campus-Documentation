# Release Announcement: NexPort Campus 6.7.0

We are thrilled to announce the release of NexPort Campus version 6.7.0, packed with a range of powerful new features and enhancements designed to elevate your learning management experience. Our team has been hard at work to bring you a host of capabilities that will enhance functionality, streamline processes, and provide you with greater flexibility and control. Let's dive into the exciting additions:

**Enhanced Point of Sale (PoS) Methods: Add Purchasing Group** Now, with the new update, you can associate a purchasing group with your PoS methods. This feature allows you to seamlessly track and manage purchases within specific purchasing groups, providing you with improved organizational capabilities.

**Remote Redemption Unassignment** We understand the importance of maintaining control over student access to resources. With the latest update, remote systems can now unassign redemptions from students, granting you the ability to modify or revoke access as needed.

**Daily Usage Statistics for Tenant Orgs** Administrators can now access daily usage statistics for each tenant organization. This invaluable feature enables you to gain deeper insights into the usage patterns and activities within your different tenant organizations, empowering you with data-driven decision-making.

**Streamlined Invoice Item Retrieval** Remote systems can now retrieve individual invoice items from existing invoices. This enhancement allows for smoother integration with external systems, ensuring effortless access to specific billing information tied to individual items on an invoice.

**Mark Organizations as Tenant Orgs** System Operators now have the ability to mark specific organizations as tenant organizations. This enhancement provides you with greater flexibility and control, ensuring that these organizations receive the privileges and settings associated with tenant status.

**Customizable Enrollment Start Dates** Admins can now set Enrollment Start Dates that differ from the creation date. This feature empowers you to define specific start dates for student enrollments, even if the course or program was created earlier, enabling seamless scheduling and planning.

**BioSig-ID Verification for Assignments** To enhance security and authentication, students will now be presented with BioSig-ID[^1] verification for every assignment mapped within an [Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS)](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] Course. This feature ensures a secure submission process and maintains the integrity of student work.

**Streamlined NMLS Curriculum Mapping** Curriculum Developers can now easily map sections to NMLS Courses, enabling efficient organization and categorization of course content within the NMLS framework.

**NMLS Provider Profiles** Org Admins now have the ability to add NMLS Provider Profiles to their organizations. This enhancement enables seamless integration of NMLS Provider Profiles, ensuring regulatory compliance and accreditation requirements are met.

**Linking NMLS Profiles to Sections** Curriculum Developers can now map an organization's NMLS Profile to a section, facilitating a strong connection between an organization's NMLS Profile and specific sections within the course structure.

But that's not all! NexPort Campus 6.7.0 also brings several other exciting enhancements, including NMLS Integration with Sections and Assignments, improved visibility of invoices and expenses for Partners and Billing admins, upgraded Zoom Integration, and revised help documentation to ensure a smooth user experience.

We're thrilled to deliver these powerful features and enhancements to NexPort Campus. We believe they will revolutionize your learning management experience, provide greater flexibility, and help you achieve your educational goals more efficiently.
