# NexPort Campus v6.7.0 Release Notes

## Bugs Resolved

### Certificate Template Rendering fails with a poor message if the HTML has a problem ([Bug 171078](https://darwin-global.fogbugz.com/f/cases/171078))

Certificate Templates give clearer message when an Error occurs A friendly message now comes up when you try to upload a corrupted Certificate Template.

Courseware Upload success message now means something When you upload courseware, the system gives you a success message stating the Courseware has been uploaded.
