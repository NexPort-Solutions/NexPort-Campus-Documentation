# Announcing NexPort Campus Version 6.7.2

We are excited to roll out NexPort Campus Version 6.7.2! As part of our commitment to deliver the best e-learning experience, weâ€™ve introduced a series of enhancements and addressed several key issues. Hereâ€™s a closer look at whatâ€™s new:

**Enhancements:**

1. **Player Version on Courseware Owned Tab**: For an enriched overview, the Courseware Owned tab now showcases the Player Version for each course, helping you identify and manage content better.
2. **Flexible Help Tab Management**: Admins can now selectively hide the Help tab from users' view. The hidden status won't disrupt its vital functionalities; students can still reset passwords even if the help area is off.
3. **Direct Enrollment ID Access**: For improved management, administrators can effortlessly view system enrollment IDs for each student, streamlining admin tasks.
4. **Insight on Certificate Templates**: Gain clarity on enrollments! Now, admins can determine the specific certificate template used and if any replacements were applied for individual enrollments.
5. **Open-Ended Invoice Redemptions**: Adding versatility, weâ€™ve enhanced invoice items to support open-ended redemptions through the web API, allowing the catalog or section specification at the point of redemption.
6. **Improved Course Description Interface**: Students will benefit from the revamped interface, with options to collapse or auto-collapse course descriptions once a course is launched.
7. **Inter-Organization Section Copying**: Bolstering admin capabilities, the update facilitates copying a section from a catalog in one organization to another, eliminating the prior need to assign the section to a catalog.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **Orphaned SCO Handling**: Enhanced system behavior to tackle orphaned SCO attempts, optimizing the experience when course SCOs change post-student launch.
* **NexportCampus.dll Issue**: Rectified the corruption problem that hindered beta performance post-build.
* **Catalog Categories Consistency**: Ensured changing the organization of a section copy removes old catalog categories.
* **AJAX Error Resolution**: AJAX errors during catalog purchases are now a thing of the past.
* **Transcript Record Accuracy**: Optimized system behavior to attach the correct transcript record for fulfillments.
* **Process Membership Queue Job**: Addressed and resolved occurring errors.
* **Web API Stability**: Fixed the exception occurring during training plan enrollment verification.
* **NMLS Settings Security**: Enhanced settings to prevent unintended manipulations.

Since NexPort Campus is a hosted service, youâ€™ll experience these improvements the next time you log in.
