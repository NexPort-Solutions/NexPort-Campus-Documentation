| Custom enrollment fields                               | Organizations can choose to extend the data fields tracked for each enrollment. There is no limit to the number of extra fields that can be added to an organization. These fields are defined at the organization level. Student input assignments can be used to have students self-fill these fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Custom profile fields                                  | Custom profile fields allow organizations to extend the default profile for their users. A custom profile field can be any information important to the organization; license number, graduation date, and others. These fields can also be marked. When a field is marked required students are asked to fill in the field before continuing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Discussion assignment                                  | You can create discussion topics and comment back and forth using the discussion board.

This sorting ability is known as a topic thread. Threads allow all conversations with the same topic to be grouped together. Threaded discussions also allow users to reply to a specific posting within a thread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Organizational model                                   | <p>In the Organizational model, the student is subscribed to an organization or university. Within that organization, they may be assigned membership to various groups.</p><p>Learning resources or assets that include catalogs, sections, and training plans, are shared with the various groups. Students who subscribe to an organization can view the courses available to them, based on the membership that they have, when they log on.</p><p></p><p>For instance, if a student is a member of three different groups, and each group has four different catalogs, the student would have access to 12 different catalogs containing SCORM compliant courseware.</p><p>In summary, the organizational model is based on group membership.</p><p></p><p><em>See also <strong>Point of Sale model</strong></em></p> |

| Survey assignment                                      | NexPort provides you with two separate ways to create surveys. You can customize your survey to include as many questions and choices as you would like. You are also provided the ability to create a fill-in-the-blank option for surveys with the "Fill in response" or comment options. Surveys will be saved until you choose to delete them, and the survey can be revised at any time. Surveys can be administered through assignments through the classroom portion of the site. Surveys can also be created in the "My Events" portion of the site. Survey assignments refer to all surveys created as an assignment in the classroom.

| VTL                                                    | [Velocity Template Language (VTL)](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.6/user-guide.html) is an effective way to insert dynamic content into text fields in NexPort Campus. Many areas of NexPort allow administrators to use VTL to make their campus more interactive. VTL allows simple property replacement (such as the current date or student name) and complex logical operators including foreach loops and if/then statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Weighted grades                                        | You can use this feature to make one assignment worth more than another assignment, even if each assignment is worth 100 points. For example, if you need the grades of initial assignments to be worth less than a final assignment, you can create a weighted grading scheme to allow you to do this. Weighted grades allow you to assign a weight to each assignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
