## **Instructor-led sections:**

Instructor-led sections allow students to be trained online with the guidance of an Instructor. This type of section usually has individual deadlines for assignments and lessons, as well as a deadline for completing the section.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
## **Self-paced sections:**

Self-paced sections have less time bound deadlines and are under the supervision of an Instructor. The student could move on to other material while waiting for a grade. Students are not expected to proceed through this self-paced section with a group. There often is a maximum time limit that student may take to complete the section, but this time limit is usually far longer than it takes to complete the material.

You can view the existing list of sections for a organization in which you are an Instructor and you can also search a specific section. Also, you can access any of the section listed in the Section column to view the list of courses that you are assigned to instruct.
