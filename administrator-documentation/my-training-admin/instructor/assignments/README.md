Assignments are activities that an Instructor assigns to the student to complete. NexPort Campus enables you to create writing assignments, tests, surveys, courseware assignments, discussion board assignments, manually graded assignments, media assignments, quality assurance assignments and swappable assignments for students. When the assignment is submitted by the students, the Instructor is able to evaluate the assignments and provide feedback.
