### Test assignment <a href="#test_assignment" id="test_assignment"></a>

The test assignments can be set as either graded or ungraded assignments. Test questions are always randomized by default. You can restrict the time a student has to take a test with assessment time limits or set test time limits with a live countdown on the test interface page. You can also allow multiple attempts to give the students the opportunity to re-take tests. You can also allow unlimited test attempts or set a maximum attempt limit.

The following image illustrates the test assignment type.

The following table provides explanation for the user inputs that are required for the various sections and fields to manage test assignment.
