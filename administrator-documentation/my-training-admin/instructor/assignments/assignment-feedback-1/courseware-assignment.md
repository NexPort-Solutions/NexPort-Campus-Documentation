| <mark style="color:blue;">**Supplemental Assignment**</mark> | When an assignment is marked as supplemental, it will be hidden to students **unless** you assign it to them. This can be useful when an assignment should only be assigned as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Note: Marking an assignment as supplemental is a **_**permanent**_** change.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
