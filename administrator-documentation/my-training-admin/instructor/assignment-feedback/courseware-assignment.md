Courseware is a term used by NexPort to refer to SCORM packaged lessons that can be assigned as part of a section. When a SCORM courseware is uploaded to an organization an administrator can make it available to students within a section using the Courseware Assignment.

Note:

NexPort™ currently supports only SCORM™ 1.2 version. The SCORM packaging and communications specification is maintained by the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative.
