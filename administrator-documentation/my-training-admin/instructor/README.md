# Instructor

From the <mark style="color:blue;">**Instructor**</mark> tab, you can assign assignments to the students, evaluate the assignments, and provide feedback to the students. You can add, modify, and delete an assignment and the assignment heading that are to be included in the section. Through gradebook, you can track the progress of the students.

On the <mark style="color:blue;">**Instructor**</mark> page, you can do the following:

{% content-ref url="../../administrator-reference/campus-management/group-tools/sections/view-and-search-section.md" %}
[view-and-search-section.md](../../administrator-reference/campus-management/group-tools/sections/view-and-search-section.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="assignments/" %}
[assignments](assignments/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="assignments/assignment-feedback-1/" %}
[assignment-feedback-1](assignments/assignment-feedback-1/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="gradebook.md" %}
[gradebook.md](gradebook.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
