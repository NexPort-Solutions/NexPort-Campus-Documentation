## Survey Reporting <a href="#kanchor39" id="kanchor39"></a>

Survey Reports summarize and aggregate the responses and response data of surveys that are assigned to students.

NexPort Campus offers flexibility to generate a survey report depending on your requirement, thus enabling you to make informed decision. For example, you can generate a survey report for an organization with all the sub-organization (child organization) and groups.

On the **Survey Reports** page, you can do the following:

* [View and search the survey report](https://www.nexportcampus.com/Content/Guides/aweb/Content/Module\_Topics/Survey\_Report/Survey\_reporting.htm#View)
