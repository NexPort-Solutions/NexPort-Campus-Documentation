##

The transcript evaluation tool allows you to apply credit for training plan requirements that have been met by the student elsewhere. As well as applying credit for courses taken elsewhere you can attach a copy of the transcript record (PDF or other document) used to apply credit. You can edit or destroy the transcript evaluation you have added. The transcript evaluations can only be applied to training plan enrollments. A transcript evaluation records the evaluator (you), date applied, transcript file, notes on the evaluation (required) and requirements the transcript evaluation fulfills (usually a section requirement).

On the **Transcript Evaluation** tab, you can do the following:

* [Add a transcript evaluation](https://www.nexportcampus.com/Content/Guides/aweb/Content/Module\_Topics/User\_Management/Add\_a\_transcript\_evaluation.htm)
