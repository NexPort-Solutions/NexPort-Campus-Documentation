# Manage Student Documents

You are here: [Section Two: Administrator reference](https://www.nexportcampus.com/Content/Guides/aweb/Content/Module\_Topics/Administration\_reference.htm) > [User management](https://www.nexportcampus.com/Content/Guides/aweb/Content/Module\_Topics/User\_Management/User\_management.htm) > Manage student documents

##

Student documents are placed either in administrative bookshelf or in documents bookshelf. Students can only view the documents bookshelf and not the administrative bookshelf. NexPort adds some types of documents to the student record. These include completion certificates and transcripts uploaded from the transcript evaluations tool.

NexPort stores Transcript Evaluation records in the Administrative documents bookshelf under the transcript evaluations folder and Certificates are placed in the Documents bookshelf under the certificates folder. Each student or user can have one or more files stored as part of their student record. You can add, rename, delete, and upload documents or other types of files.

On the **Documents** tab, you can do the following:

* [Add a folder](https://www.nexportcampus.com/Content/Guides/aweb/Content/Module\_Topics/User\_Management/Add\_a\_folder\_UM.htm)
* [Upload a file to a folder](https://www.nexportcampus.com/Content/Guides/aweb/Content/Module\_Topics/User\_Management/Upload\_a\_file\_to\_a\_folder\_UM.htm)
* [Add a hyperlink to a folder](https://www.nexportcampus.com/Content/Guides/aweb/Content/Module\_Topics/User\_Management/Add\_a\_hyperlink\_to\_a\_folder\_UM.htm)
