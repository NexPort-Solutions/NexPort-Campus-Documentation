# Manage Student Documents

Students can only view the documents bookshelf and not the administrative bookshelf. NexPort adds some types of documents to the student record. These include completion certificates and transcripts uploaded from the transcript evaluations tool.

NexPort stores Transcript Evaluation records in the Administrative documents bookshelf under the transcript evaluations folder and Certificates are placed in the Documents bookshelf under the certificates folder. Each student or user can have one or more files stored as part of their student record. You can add, rename, delete, and upload documents or other types of files.
