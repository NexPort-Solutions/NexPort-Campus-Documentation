# User Management

User ManagementHere you are able to add new users, upload spreadsheets of users or view or modify the user account details. The Manage Users area allows you to see all aspects of a user’s account. This includes their profile, subscriptions, enrollments, documents, transcript, communications and other aspects of a user account.

On the **Manage Users** page, you can do the following:

{% content-ref url="view-and-search-user-listing.md" %}
[view-and-search-user-listing.md](view-and-search-user-listing.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="add-a-user.md" %}
[add-a-user.md](add-a-user.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="modify-user-details/" %}
[modify-user-details](modify-user-details/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="upload-users.md" %}
[upload-users.md](upload-users.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="delete-a-user.md" %}
[delete-a-user.md](delete-a-user.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="manage-enrollments/" %}
[manage-enrollments](manage-enrollments/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
