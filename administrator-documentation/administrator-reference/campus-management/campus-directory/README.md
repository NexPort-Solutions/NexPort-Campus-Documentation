# Campus Directory

## Campus Directory

The campus directory is displayed as a tree of groups and organizations. You can create a directory structure that matches your business structure. The NexPort Campus directory maintains the structure and keeps your students, customers, organizational unit, and resellers organized for you.

From the Campus directory, you can do the following

{% content-ref url="view-and-search-for-an-organization-or-a-group.md" %}
[view-and-search-for-an-organization-or-a-group.md](view-and-search-for-an-organization-or-a-group.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="add-an-organization.md" %}
[add-an-organization.md](add-an-organization.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="add-a-group.md" %}
[add-a-group.md](add-a-group.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="rename-an-organization-or-a-group.md" %}
[rename-an-organization-or-a-group.md](rename-an-organization-or-a-group.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="move-selected-organization-or-a-group.md" %}
[move-selected-organization-or-a-group.md](move-selected-organization-or-a-group.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="delete-an-organization-or-a-group.md" %}
[delete-an-organization-or-a-group.md](delete-an-organization-or-a-group.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
