## Add requirements using the palette

A training plan enrollment is considered complete when all requirements have been met by the student. You can create categories, sections, electives and/or transcripts, and then add those as requirements in this area, as mentioned in the following table.

&#x20;

| Requirement    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Category**   | A category is similar to a department or division. For example, categories allow you to have a folder named ‘English’ with sections and transcripts in the category folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Section**    | A section is an aggregate of assignments for which a user can enroll. The section requirement allows you to specify one or more equivalent sections. If any of these sections are completed by the student then this requirement will be marked as fulfilled (completed). For more information about assigning or removing role permissions, see [Sections](https://www.nexportcampus.com/Content/Guides/aweb/Content/Module\_Topics/Campus\_Management/Group\_Tools/Sections/Sections.htm). |
| **Elective**   | Electives allow students to select from two or more categories under the elective. When a student selects a category that category becomes the requirement in place of the elective requirement within that student’s enrollment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Transcript** | Transcript requirements force a student to certify whether they still have transcript from other educational institutions that they would like applied to this training plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
