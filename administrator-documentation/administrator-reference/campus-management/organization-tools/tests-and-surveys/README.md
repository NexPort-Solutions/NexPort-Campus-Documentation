# Tests and Surveys

Tests record student answers and can be used for grade contribution to a subject. Surveys help the instructors get student feedback on a topic. Student survey responses can be analyzed to provide statistical results. Tests and surveys are collection of questions drawn at random from one or more question banks. This random selection allows the student to be presented with different questions each time they attempt the test.

You can create single or multiple question banks, as well as multiple test types. Test types include single select, multi-select, or five-point scale question types.
