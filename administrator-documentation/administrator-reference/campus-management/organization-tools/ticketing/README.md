# Ticketing

A ticket is a link that is sent to a student. When the student clicks the link, they can create an account and subscribe to the organization associated with the ticket’s batch. This is known as ‘redeeming’ the ticket.

Tickets are collected into ticket batches. Rules about how the tickets can be redeemed are specified on the ticket batch. These rules apply to all tickets in the batch.

Existing students who redeem a ticket can have a new subscription and memberships tied to their existing login. Ticket batches can also be downloaded as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and sent to third-party administrators who may dispense those tickets to their students or employees. You can add or modify a ticket batch and also redeem a ticket.
