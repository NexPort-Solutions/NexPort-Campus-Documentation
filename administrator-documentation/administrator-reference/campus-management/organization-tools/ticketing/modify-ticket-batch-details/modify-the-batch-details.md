| Field                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Automatic Dispensing**               | Tickets must be redeemed using each ticket’s individual dispensing URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
