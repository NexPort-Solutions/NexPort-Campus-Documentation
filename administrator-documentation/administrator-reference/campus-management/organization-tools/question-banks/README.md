NexPort Campus supports use of math and scientific notation through <mark style="color:blue;">**mathjax**</mark>. It uses ASCIIMath, TeX, and LaTeX notations for its markup.

NexPort Campus supports the following question types:

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Single Select:**</mark> This is a single choice type of question, and there is only one correct option that the students can select.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Multi-Select:**</mark> This is a multiple choice type of question, and there can be more than one correct option that the students can select.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Five Point Scale:**</mark> This is also referred to as the Likert scale that is used to measure the attitude wherein the students are asked to indicate the level of agreement or disagreement for a statement which are asked in form of a question. It is typically a five response category scale ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’. For example, the student might be asked to rate "Will the tax cut policy be beneficial?" by assigning the five point scale as strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree.
