# Organization Tools

The <mark style="color:blue;">**Organization Tools**</mark> menu allows you to manage all aspects of your campus’s content and sub-organizations. This includes completion certificates, course catalogs, permissions, course sets, courseware, question banks, subscriptions, assessments, and training plans, among others. Access to the organization tools is governed by role based access control.

An organization can be conceptualized as a university campus or a school district. It could be a corporate entity, government body, NGO, educational institution, or other training provider. An organization can be divided into sub organizations and could also consist of various functional areas such as, divisions, departments, or teams. NexPort conceptualized each such entity as a group. Groups allow a single organization to divide its students into functional areas. The following table provides a list of organization tools with their description.
