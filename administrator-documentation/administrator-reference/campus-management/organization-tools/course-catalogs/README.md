# Course Catalogs

After a catalog is populated with training content that content can be shared to members of the groups within your organization or shared to other organizations in your campus. You can view and manage the list of all the course catalogs created in your organization. You can search one or more catalogs by typing the key words in the <mark style="color:blue;">**Search**</mark> box. The search results matching the key words are populated on the <mark style="color:blue;">**Course Catalogs**</mark> page.
