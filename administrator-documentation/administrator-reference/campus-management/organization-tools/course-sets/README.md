# Course Sets

You can view and manage an existing list of all the course sets created in your organization. A course set is a selection or compilation of SCORM courseware that can be administered and shared with an organization, sub-organization, or group. Courseware can be included in a section as an assignment. An organization manages the course sets separately. Course sets are similar to catalogs.
