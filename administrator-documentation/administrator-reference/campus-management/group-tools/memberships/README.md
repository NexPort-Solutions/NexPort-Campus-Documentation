# Memberships

You can assign membership to a user. You can also view the list of all members of your organization, search members, send an email to the members, and remove membership.&#x20;

After creating an organization, you must add users to your organization. After adding users, you can provide users with membership. Users (or students) can also enroll for sections through membership.

On the <mark style="color:blue;">**Memberships**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;"></mark> page, you can do the following:

{% content-ref url="assign-a-membership.md" %}
[assign-a-membership.md](assign-a-membership.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="view-and-search-members.md" %}
[view-and-search-members.md](view-and-search-members.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../permissions/send-a-notification.md" %}
[send-a-notification.md](../permissions/send-a-notification.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="delete-a-membership.md" %}
[delete-a-membership.md](delete-a-membership.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
