# Group Tools

The <mark style="color:blue;">**Group Tools**</mark> menu provides you with tools to manage groups that facilitate in the smooth administration and management of activities related to learning. This includes customization of the user interface, bookshelves, memberships, sections, and viewing logs, among others. Access to the group tools is governed by role based access control.

An organization can also consist of various divisions, departments, or teams. Each such entity can be conceptualized as a group in the NexPort Campus. The following table provides a list of group tools with their description.
