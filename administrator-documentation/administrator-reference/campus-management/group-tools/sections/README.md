# Sections

A section is a collection of assignments and the rules for how a student must complete those assignments. The final score for a section is derived from the scores and weights of its assignments. The curriculum developers have the privilege to arrange the assignments within a section. This includes prerequisite rules, start date, completion dates, weighting, and others.

NexPort Campus provides Instructor-led sections (facilitated section) and self-paced sections.

A section may either be self-paced instruction with a combination of courseware, media and tests or instructor led with assignments such as the writing and discussion assignments. The self-paced section assignment types are similar to Instructor-led section assignment type.

## **Instructor-led sections**

Instructor-led sections allows students to be trained online with the guidance of an instructor. This type of section usually has individual deadlines for assignments and lessons, as well as a deadline for completing the section.

## **Self-paced sections**

Self-paced sections have less time bound deadlines and are under the supervision of an instructor. The student could move on to other material while waiting for a grade. Students are not expected to proceed through this self-paced section with a group. There often is a maximum time limit that student may take to complete the section, but this time limit is usually far longer than it takes to complete the material.
