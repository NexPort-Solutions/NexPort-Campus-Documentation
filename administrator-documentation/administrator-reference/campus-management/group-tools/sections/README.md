# Sections (Courses)

NexPort Campus employs a structured approach to learning by organizing educational content into Sections. A Section in NexPort Campus is a comprehensive unit that encompasses a series of assignments along with the rules governing the completion and assessment of those assignments. This framework is meticulously designed to provide a coherent and effective learning experience, catering to the diverse needs and pacing of learners.

### Defining Sections

At the core of a Section is a set of assignments, each with its own objectives, content, and assessment criteria. The overall performance of a student in a Section is calculated based on the individual scores obtained in these assignments, factored by their respective weights. This methodology ensures a balanced evaluation of a student's understanding and mastery of the subject matter.

#### Curriculum Development and Management

Curriculum developers are bestowed with the capability to strategically organize the assignments within a Section. This organization extends to setting prerequisites for assignments, scheduling start and completion dates, and determining the weight of each assignment in the overall Section score. Such granular control allows for the creation of a tailored educational pathway that aligns with the learning objectives and outcomes of the course.

#### Section Types

NexPort Campus offers two primary types of Sections to accommodate different learning styles and instructional strategies:

* **Instructor-Led Sections**: These Sections are characterized by active facilitation from instructors. Assignments may include interactive components such as writing tasks and discussions, allowing for direct engagement and feedback between instructors and students. This format is ideal for courses where instructor guidance is paramount to the learning process.
* **Self-Paced Sections**: Designed for autonomous learning, these Sections allow students to progress through courseware, media, and tests at their own pace. This format is suited for learners who prefer flexibility and self-direction in their educational journey.

#### Assignment Types

Both Instructor-led and Self-paced Sections employ a similar assortment of assignment types, ensuring consistency in content delivery and assessment. This uniformity allows for a seamless transition between different types of Sections, providing learners with a cohesive learning experience irrespective of the instructional method chosen.
