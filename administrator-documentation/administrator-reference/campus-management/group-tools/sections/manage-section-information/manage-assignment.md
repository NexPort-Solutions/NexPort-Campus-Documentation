# Manage Assignment

You can add, modify, and delete an assignment and assignment heading. You can also add assignment headings to group assignments under and set a section mastery which allows a student to pass a section even if they have failed individual assignments. The total combined weighted points that a student earns on all assignments in a section must be at least the section mastery score for the student to pass the section.

The Instructor can assign various types of assignments to the students. For more information about various types of assignments:
