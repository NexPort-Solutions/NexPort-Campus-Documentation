### Student Input assignment <a href="#student" id="student"></a>

Student input assignment includes a template of custom profile or enrollment field inputs for the student to fill in. Instructors can ask a student to resubmit input assignments as many times as required or they can set the assignment to be graded automatically. This type of assignment calls for students to enter data through a date picker, text box or check box. You can also set late assignment parameters.

The following image illustrates the student input assignment type.

### Test assignment <a href="#test_assignment" id="test_assignment"></a>

Test assignment allow you to make an exam available to students within NexPort Campus. The test assignments can be set as graded or ungraded assignments. Test questions are always randomized by default. You can restrict the time a student has to take a test with assessment time limits or set test time limits with a live countdown on the test interface page. You can also allow multiple attempts to give the students the opportunity to re-take tests. You can also allow unlimited test attempts or set a maximum attempt limit.

The following image illustrates the test assignment type.

### Writing assignment <a href="#writing" id="writing"></a>

NexPort Campus allows students to submit assignments in two ways. Students can create a document using the Rich Text Editor or they can upload a document they have created previously with external software by using the document upload. You can add or modify your grade boundaries based on mark percentage.

The following image illustrates the writing assignment type.

The following table provides explanation for the user inputs that are required for the various sections and fields to manage writing assignment.
