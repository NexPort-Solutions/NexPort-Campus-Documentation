# Documents (Admin)

You can simplify the learning process if you are using various documents. NexPort Campus provides a bookshelf as personal storage space for your documents. In the bookshelf, you can create various folders and use this area to upload, organize, and share your documents. You can upload documents, webpages, image, video, and audio files.

There is a <mark style="color:blue;">**Media Library**</mark> folder that includes the default structure: documents, images, videos, webpages, and others, as subfolders. You cannot share, add, rename, or delete the Media Library folder or its subfolders. However, you can add, modify, rename, or delete the files inside the documents, images, others, videos, and webpages subfolders.

The following table provides the file formats supported by NexPort Campus.
