## How to assign an Instructor?

Instructor-led curriculum offers real-time feedback, questions and answers, and flexible delivery to suit the needs of the students in a real-time environment. Students undertake the course under the guidance and supervision of an Instructor, who is assigned to the section. Such courses follow a blended approach in terms of ‘marrying’ the conventional or traditional approach to teaching, with the technological advancements of hosting digital content on an LMS.
