# Set Up Your Campus

## Set up your Campus

Within NexPort an organization can be conceptualized as a university campus or a school district. It could be a corporate entity, government body, NGO, educational institution, or other training provider. This top level organization is referred as your campus root organization.

An organization can be divided into sub organizations. For example, ABC University may have multiple schools or campuses across the US. Each such school or campus can be defined as a sub organization in the ABC’s root organization. An organization can also consist of various functional areas: divisions, departments, or teams. Each such entity can be conceptualized as a group in the NexPort. Groups allow a single organization to divide its students into functional areas. You can create as many groups and sections for your organization and organize your portal as you need, based on your business goals.

To provide a perspective on the organization hierarchy, here’s a visual representation on how an organization can be structured.

## How to set up an organization? <a href="#how" id="how"></a>

An Administrator can create sub-organizations, and groups. You can create and share assets and learning resources such as bookshelf, purchases made, course catalog, course set, courseware, among others, with sub organizations and groups under root organization. Furthermore, content from sub-organizations can be shared across your entire campus as well.
