# Deliver Content Other Than Instruction

After you have organized a campus and created instructional content for students you may need to provide other content such as documents, images, videos, and web pages. Learning resources other than instructional content include web pages and documents that are to be made available to the students. Bookshelf’s and pages are the primary delivery mechanisms.

## How to add a bookshelf <a href="#how" id="how"></a>

You can share documents, images, video, and other files through a bookshelf. A bookshelf is a virtual storage area where you can upload, organize, and share various learning resources. You can upload documents, images, videos, audio files, and webpages under appropriate subfolders in a bookshelf.

1. Click **Administration** > **Manage Campus** > **Group Tools** > **Documents** > **Browse**.
2. Click the ![](/.gitbook/assets/Bookshelf.png) icon, type the values, and then click **Save**.

## How to share a page <a href="#how2" id="how2"></a>

You can create a homepage and also add pages that can be subordinate to the homepage. On the homepage, you create learning material, section notices, and news for the students, or post reminders for deadlines. You can also include syllabi and other course materials on this page. The homepage can be conceptualized as a dashboard for a student to launch courses and view notices and other messages in their membership area.

Group pages must be shared to groups before they are visible to students. When a group’s pages are shared to a group all students with a membership in those groups have access to those pages.
